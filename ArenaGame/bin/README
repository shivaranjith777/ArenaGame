Magical Arena Game

Welcome to the Magical Arena game! 
In this game, two players engage in a battle until one's health reaches zero. 
Players take turns attacking and defending, rolling dice to determine the outcome of each action.

Game Description :

     Players => 
        Each player is defined by three attributes :
     
             => Health: Represents the player's remaining health points. The player dies if their health reaches zero.
                           
             => Strength: Represents the player's defensive capability. It is used to defend against incoming attacks.
                           
             => Attack: Represents the player's offensive capability. It is used to inflict damage on the opponent.
                           
             => Players take turns attacking and defending.
                           
Combat Mechanics :

      => Attacking : The attacking player rolls the attacking dice to determine the attack value. 
      This value is then multiplied by the player's attack attribute to calculate the damage dealt to the opponent.

      => Defending: The defending player rolls the defending dice to determine the defense value. 
      This value is then multiplied by the player's strength attribute to calculate the damage defended against.
      
      => Damage Calculation: The damage inflicted on the defending player is the difference between the attack damage and 
      the defense damage. If the defense damage exceeds the attack damage, no damage is inflicted.

      => Turn-based: Players take turns attacking and defending until one player's health reaches zero.


Example Scenario :
                   Player A:
                        Health: 50
                        Strength: 5
                        Attack: 10
   
                   Player B:
                        Health: 100
                        Strength: 10
                        Attack: 5
                        
                   Dice:
                        Attacking and defending dice are both 6-sided with values ranging from 1 to 6.
